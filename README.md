# Liver Disease Prediction Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict liver disease based on patient data. The model has been trained and evaluated using various algorithms and has been deployed for interactive use on Streamlit.

## Project Components

- **Machine Learning Model**: A trained model that predicts the likelihood of liver disease based on input features.
- **Streamlit Deployment**: An interactive web application allowing users to input data and receive predictions.
- **Medium Article**: A detailed explanation of the project, including the model development process and results.

## Features

- **Predictive Accuracy**: The model has been evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using different algorithms.
- **Interactive Interface**: The Streamlit app provides an easy-to-use interface for making predictions.
